# React Arrow Game

This is a React-based Arrow Game project, built with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, Vitest for testing, and Vite for fast development. The game was inspired by a YouTube tutorial series, and I made several customizations to the style, structure, icons, and more to make it unique. The primary goal of this project was to learn and implement Redux and testing practices.
